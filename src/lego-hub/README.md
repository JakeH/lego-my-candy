# Lego Hub

This is all a WIP.

## Setup

`npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --add-python-to-path`

This will take quite some time. If it has not completed after 20 minutes...

After the build tools are installed, a regular `npm ci` will finish the job.

## Debug / Test

`npm run hub:debug` will start the prompt-driven tester.
